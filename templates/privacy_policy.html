    <h3>Policy</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">This Privacy Policy describes how we (LuciusTensors) collect, use, and share
        information when you use our website that offers AI-powered functionality.</p>

    <h5>1. Information We Collect</h5>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">We do not collect any personal user data directly on our website. Our services are powered by a third-party AI API. As such, any data generated or processed by the API is subject to the AI API provider's data handling policies. This may include your inputs and the AI-generated outputs.</p>

    <h5>2. API Data Handling</h5>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Our website utilizes a third-party AI API for AI product functionality. The AI API provider may securely retain API inputs and outputs for a period to provide services, identify abuse, and improve their offerings. You can refer to the AI API provider's privacy documentation for more details on their data handling.</p>

    <h5>3. Access to Stored Data</h5>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Access to API business data stored on the AI API provider's systems is limited to authorized employees who require access for engineering support, investigating potential platform abuse, and legal compliance. Additionally, specialized third-party contractors may have access, bound by confidentiality and security obligations, solely for reviewing abuse and misuse.</p>

    <h5>4. Security Measures</h5>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the information processed through the AI API. However, it's essential to be aware that data transmitted over the internet is not entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to or from our website.</p>

    <h5>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other
        operational, legal, or
        regulatory reasons. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will be available on our website.</p>

    <h5>7. Contact Us</h5>
